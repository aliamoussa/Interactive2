          <p> There's still a large debate whether or not technology is actually making us smarter or more stupid. Yes, we have greatly benefited from all the technological advances we've made in the last hundreds of years. but this has lead to <em> a large dependency </em> that many people can't get rid of.</p>

          <p> Dependency aside, here are some examples on how we've grown as a society thanks to technology:

       
          <ul>
            <li> The best advantage of any technology is that it increases the efficiency of a business process.</li>

          <li> With the help of technology a lot of activities such as cooking, cleaning, working, commuting are accomplished faster.</li>

          <li> In earlier times, communicating with a person in a different part of the world was difficult. Now we can easily connect with a person sitting in another corner of the world</li>

          <li> Supposedly it reduces cybercrime risks?? </li>

        </ul>
      </p>

        <p> At the end of the day, it just <b> depends on the person </b> and their ability to distinguish when it's  really necessary to use the Internet or a piece of technology to solve a problem. </p>

        <p>
          Technology has become so advanced, we see it everywhere and it helps us in <b> our daily lives.</b> But it might have reached the point where we tend to rely on technology too much. People have this idea that in the future <em> technology will be doing everything for us, </em> and that’s not exactly a good thing. Our dependency has gone so far that instead of writing, we type. Instead of working out a math problem, we use a calculator. We use technology to make our meals, wash our clothes and even use the bathroom. The simplest of everyday tasks have become too much for people so they need some sort of device to do it for them.
        </p>
        

        <p> Several signs that people have become too dependent on technology, according to mnn.com are:

<ul>
  <li>  If the internet is down, you won’t be doing any more   work for the rest of the day </li>
    <li> People aren’t living in the moment anymore </li>
  <li> Something as simple as remembering your friends phone number is difficult </li>
  <li> Face-to-face confrontation is avoided as much as possible </li>
  <li> Without your phone, you feel naked </li>
</ul>
        </p>

        <p> Just thirty years ago, children were running outside and playing sports, but now all you see are kids under the age of five <b>holding iPads.</b> No matter where you go, whether it be at work or on the train to school, you will see a vast majority of people looking down at their phones, listening to music, etc. And even if two individuals were standing right next to each other, chances are they won’t be holding a conversation (they’re avoiding as much human interaction as they can). </p>

        <p> There are also a handful of personal consequences that arise from constant use of technology: </p>

  <ul> 
    <li> Addiction (it’s clear that for some people they get extreme anxiety whenever technology is inaccessible) </li>
    <li> Memory (because our minds know the information is being stored elsewhere, it’s less important for us to remember it) </li>
  <li> Skills (using technology regularly to replace a skill may also gradually reduce our ability to access that skill) </li>
</ul>

    <p> We put so much trust into technology, but it’s also not 100% reliable either. There’s always the possibility of <b> being hacked or it breaking down.</b> People are making decisions not based on their own accord, but rather what technology tells us. This proves that independent thinking is gradually diminishing and people will slowly turn into robots. </p>
