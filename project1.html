    <h1>Do you really not remember your mom's phone number?</h1>  

    <p> Technology has become so advanced, we see it everywhere and it helps us in our daily lives. But it might have reached the point where we tend to rely on technology too much. People have this idea that in the future technology will be doing everything for us, and that’s not exactly a good thing. Our dependency has gone so far that instead of writing, we type. Instead of working out a math problem, we use a calculator. We use technology to make our meals, wash our clothes and even use the bathroom. The simplest of everyday tasks have become too much for people so they need some sort of device to do it for them. </p>

     <p> Several signs that people have become too dependent on technology, according to mnn.com are: </p>
     <p> <ul>
    <li> If the internet is down, you won’t be doing any more work for the rest of the day </li>
    <li> People aren’t living in the moment anymore </li>
    <li>Something as simple as remembering your friends phone number is difficult </li>
    <li> Face-to-face confrontation is avoided as much as possible </li>
    <li> Without your phone, you feel naked </li>
    </ul></p>



    <p> Just thirty years ago, children were running outside and playing sports, but now all you see are kids under the age of five holding iPads. No matter where you go, whether it be at work or on the train to school, you will see a vast majority of people looking down at their phones, listening to music, etc. And even if two individuals were standing right next to each other, chances are they won’t be holding a conversation (they’re avoiding as much human interaction as they can). </p>
